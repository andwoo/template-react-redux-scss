# ⚠️ Deprecated ⚠️
This template is no longer maintained. I decided to focus on maintaining my two primarily used templates and leave it up to the user to choose which state management library to use. Please consider choosing one of these for your project:
- [template-react-scss](https://github.com/andwoo/template-react-scss)
- [template-vanilla-scss](https://github.com/andwoo/template-vanilla-scss)
